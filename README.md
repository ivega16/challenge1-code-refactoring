# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

My motivation was to refactor the web page so that it uses more concise semantics. I built this project because it represent what a jr. web developer would be introduced to when starting. This problem solves cryptic code, which can be understood by few. I learned how to consolidate different aspects involving HTML and CSS for readability and clarity.
